# 2004Misc
Historical Archive of Perl scripts written in 2004 - Misc Tools

I wrote these scripts in aprox 2003-2004 for a previous employer.

This repo is misc tools that don't quite merit their own.

scanner.wrks
- This seems to me it was scanning the ability to dial in to branch Windows NT workstations with modems attached and RAS enabled. Maybe?

newqip
- I recall a big bloated IPAM product called QIP (maybe by Lucent or a Bell Labs type?).  This script formatted IP info to import to that.
